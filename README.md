# mustard-themes

Hello all! I'm creating this repository to
collate all of the themes available for muOS.
This is a personal collection and currently
unofficial, with the intent of constantly
updating any themes posted in the muOS Discord
server as updates come through.

- If anyone would like to have their work
removed from this repository, contact me here
or in the aforementioned Discord server.

- Alternatively, please use my updates in any
way you would like (in accordance with the
intent of the original theme creator).

- If you originally made a theme featured here 
that I have then updated, you can download it
and do as you please with it! Even stick it
on your own posts as an official update if
you'd like - no credit needed :)

Thanks for reading and enjoy these themes!
